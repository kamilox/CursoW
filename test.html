				<p class="color-gray f-14 helvetica text-justify font-400">P5 is an SEO Marketing Agency.  We help businesses acquire new customers.  What distinguishes P5 from our competition is our understanding of how marketing is connected.  We get how content marketing drives SEO, social media, and website architecture... and how when connected, it all works more powerfully! We generate high-quality leads.</p>
				<p class="color-gray f-14 helvetica text-justify font-400">For us, lead generation is only the beginning.  We recognize that most leads may not be ready to buy from you immediately.  They have to be nurtured over time until they are ready to buy.</p>
				<p class="color-gray f-14 helvetica text-justify font-400">A critical skill we possess is establishing a hand-off from marketing to sales.  SEO Marketing delivers the right leads to sales, and sales must maximize the investment in these leads and deliver those new customers.</p>
				<p class="color-gray f-14 helvetica text-justify font-400">We can help sales be organized, and optimize their processes so they are responsive and efficient.  We can help sales departments use modern tools that reflect how sales are done in today's digital world.  It is not like it was even a few years ago.</p>
				<p class="color-gray f-14 helvetica text-justify font-400">Nowadays, customers are educated before the salesperson even contacts them.  This changed the role of sales.  Customers expect tailored information that addresses their specific needs.  They want it fast - and they want it now.</p>

			<h2 class="helvetica f-30">What is an SEO Marketing Agency?</h2>
			<p class="color-gray f-18 font-400 helvetica mb-10 text-justify ">
				To us at P5 Marketing, SEO Marketing is a philosophical approach to marketing that focuses on attracting prospects to your website.  This is opposed to the classic outbound strategies that are seen as an interruption by your potential prospects.  SPAM email, random phone calls, and junk mail are typical examples of outbound marketing.
			</p>
			<p class="color-gray f-18 font-400 helvetica mb-10 text-justify ">
				The term inbound marketing was coined by HubSpot - and SEO is the core of Inbound.  We are active Gold Partners with HubSpot and employ their CRM and tools whenever we can.  Many of these tools are free and save time and money.
			</p>
			<p class="color-gray f-18 font-400 helvetica mb-10 text-justify ">
				As an SEO Marketing Agency, we attract prospects who are actively researching what you have to offer.  We call this a considered purchase.  Inbound works best when the purchase price, risk, or importance justifies the purchase research required to make an informed decision.
			</p>
			<p class="color-gray f-18 font-400 helvetica mb-10 text-justify ">
				Search engine optimization (SEO) skills are a key component in Inbound marketing.  We have been using SEO as part of our corer offering since the inception of the concept.  It drives what content we develop. how we build your website, what blogs we write and so much more.  The agency part of what we do is to offer all the services you need under one roof to succeed.  A single point of responsibility for your online success.
			</p>

			<p class="color-gray f-18 font-400 helvetica mb-10 text-justify ">
				Contact us - we are always happy to discuss inbound and see if it makes sense for you.
